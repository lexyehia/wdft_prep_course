        The actual content inside is 200px wide. The text is padded by 20px left and right, and 10px top and bottom. It has a dotted border 2px thick.

        <div>
        This box has the same exact CSS styles applied to it, the distance between the two boxes is 30px. Overlap between margin is a thing.
